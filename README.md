# PRODIGY_DS_01

This is my first project (Task 1) from my internship at Prodigy InfoTech , where I dived into the exciting realm of Machine Learning. Here's a breakdown of what accomplished. 

Title: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

I gathered datasets from Kaggle .This process laid the foundation for subsequent analysis. I split the dataset into training and testing subsets and proceeded to train a Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Model. The initial model demonstrated strong performance, achieving an accuracy on the test set.
